		Sol System Common Knowledge, Corresponding to Accompanying Map [Non-diegetic text will be provided in brackets]
		<ul>
			<li>
				1. <b class="b">Heosphoros</b>: A tiny rock world with no inhabitants. Unbearably hot due to its proximity to the
				sun, several attempts to mine it have been made.
			</li>
			<li>
				2. <b class="b">Ardina</b>: One the most populated worlds in the system, and home to the most diverse kinds of life.
				Due to its abundance of natural magic, the residents of Ardina are more likely to be able to manipulate or be
				sensitive to magic than other peoples. Because of their heavy use of magic, however, their technological progress
				has been behind the rest of the Sol System. Popular destinations include Arvad in the country of Lychaea, Ametair in
				the Jekk Confederation, and Fulgonivista on the Ossaran Valdocrats. [This world will serve as a setting to integrate
				technology into classic fantasy, if that interests anyone.]
			</li>
			<li>
				3. <b class="b">Trondheim</b>: The ancestral home of giants. They have few ships, claiming little need for them. The
				gravity of the world makes it uncomfortable for smaller species. Caution is recommended for travelers as there are
				reports of undisclosed political unrest ongoing on Trondheim.
			</li>
			<li>
				4. <b class="b">Hedante</b>: A brown dwarf, Hedante only just failed to become a star itself. As such, it gives off
				a small amount of light and heat to the dozens (if not hundreds) of moons trapped in its gravity. Many moons are
				habitable, though most are unmapped.
			</li>
			<li>
				5. <b class="b">Carchedon</b>: Classified a ribbon world, Carchedon has a fixed rotation with the sun: the same side
				of the planet always faces the sun, bathing it in harmful radiation, and the same side always faces away, shrouding
				it in endless night and cold. The only inhabitable area is a 400 mile wide “ribbon” around the equator where
				conditions are tolerable. Most of the technological advances of the last 300 years have come from Carchedon up until
				recently. Popular destinations include Emerald Run, Karnak, and De Kanna. [This is our Blade Runner/Cyberpunk
				location. Everyone is stacked on top of each other, very grim techno future. You'll love it.]
			</li>
			<li>
				6. <b class="b">Taias Kine</b>: On the surface, Taias Kine appears to be a sphere of featureless ice. Break the
				surface, however, and you find a thriving world of underwater environments and peoples. Due to their living
				arrangements, they have not yet discovered a way to travel en masse out into space; only a handful of native species
				can leave the seas of their home and breathe air to travel and trade. They rely mostly on interested trading
				partners to come to them.
			</li>
			<li>
				7. <b class="b">Jahaddi</b>: The only planet past The Ring [asteroid belt] to have been explored yet. Little more
				than a large asteroid itself, Jahaddi has a toxic atmosphere that is consistently being added to by vents and cracks
				on its surface, indicative of some chemical reaction ongoing at its core.
			</li>
			<li>
				8. <b class="b">The Debris Field</b> – A popular spot for both mining and piracy, The Debris Field is just that, a
				large field of debris in space. Though most of the debris is mineral in nature, up to 3% is technological. The
				prevailing theory is that it is the remains of a planet, though a small one, that was destroyed by means yet
				unknown. The field was present when the first exploratory shuttles left Carchedon to map the Sol System.
			</li>
			<li>
				9. <b class="b">Station Zetwal</b> – Recently, the most brilliant scientific minds have been invited to move their
				research to a state-of-the-art facility on station Zetwal, under the oversight of Josiah Lourdes of LBL
				Incorporated. He claims his vision is to push the boundaries of science and that it benefits have as many inspiring
				minds in the same place as possible. Much of the rest of the station is dedicated to machining and fabrication of
				the patents that come from the research facility, which are used throughout the system.
			</li>
			<li>
				10. <b class="b">Station Heylayl </b>– If you want it, somebody on Heylayl has it. While some might find Heylayl
				debauched, the citizens of the station consider themselves honest and unrestrained. Gambling, intoxicants, and
				recreations that can't legally be found anywhere else in the system are their main draw. A strong hand from Jessica
				Brynn of LBL Incorporated is the only thing keeping the station from sliding into total chaos. [Affectionately named
				Space Vegas by the last players]
			</li>
			<li>
				11. <b class="b">Station Kintana</b> – Home to one of the fastest growing fleets in the system, Kintana is where
				most of the new exploration initiatives embark from. Desmond Luther of LBL Incorporated, who runs this station,
				makes contracts with wealthy individuals or governments to stake claims on extra terrestrial territory and defend it
				before someone else has the opportunity.
			</li>
			<li>
				12.<b class="b"> The Monument</b> – There are as many names for it as there are theories as to what it is: Titan's
				Reckoning, an ark for monsters; The Forge, a place where the Gods lived when building the world; The Freezing
				Engine, a doomsday machine to end all time and space. None can say for sure, all they know is that it's old,
				seemingly made with materials and technology beyond our current abilities, and it showed up in our solar system very
				suddenly 15 years ago. [This is where you're starting. Good luck getting out alive.]
